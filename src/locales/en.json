The latter will see two members take the field at a time, who, in a submission-only match, will attempt to earn points for their team. In addition to excellent mastery of technique on the part of the individual, it will be careful strategy and collaborative teamwork that will make the difference between victory and defeat and determine who moves on to the next round. Thus, it is cunning, planning skills and collaboration that are the key players in this new “game.”"
